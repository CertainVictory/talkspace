Running `npm i` would rid most errors for ease of viewing.

I referenced a lot of sources for Sequelize application building and applied some of my development knowledge gained over the past few years. I don't want to go over the time limit so I'll leave it here for review.

I've made the changes I suggested in my review and found a few things I missed along the way that I will take note of here and for when I meet the reviewers üòÅ

- setCredit method needs to addressed
- overall structure of this application
- easing use of datetime for futureproofing
- addressing scale
- security: auth, hipaa compliance, vault storage for secrets
- "views" or ui
- learning more about sequelize best practices
- structuring of code reviews to best suit the organization, I used emojis and "compliment sandwich"
- I also added my willingness to discuss and review the code with the reviewee
- I believe my approach was mostly universal for communicating reviews to more senior, peer, and more junior level devs but I am very open to feedback on how to improve! I avoid using names and make it about the code as opposed to blame. Removing condescension and ego. I hope you feel the same!
